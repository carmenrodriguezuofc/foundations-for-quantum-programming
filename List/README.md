# Change a List

For this activity, you will start by creating a list of strings then edit it. 

## Exercise

The Python file that you will work on is ``list_practice.py``.  Open it, then follow the instructions below:

1.	Create a new list named ``days``. Add the following strings, in order, to the list:    
     “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Wednesday”, “Friday”, and “Saturday”. (Wednesday is repeated twice.)
3.	On a separate line, replace the second occurrence of “Wednesday” with the string “Thursday”.
4.	Print the updated ``days`` list to your terminal.
